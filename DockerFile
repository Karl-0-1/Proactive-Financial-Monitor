# Dockerfile: Blueprint for building the Python application container image

# Use an official lightweight Python image as the base
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the requirements file first to leverage Docker build cache
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the Python dependencies specified in requirements.txt
# --no-cache-dir reduces the final image size slightly
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code (all .py files) into the container's /app directory
COPY . .

# No CMD or ENTRYPOINT is needed here, as the specific script to run
# (producer.py, news_producer.py, monitor_agent.py)
# will be defined in the docker-compose.yml file for each service.
